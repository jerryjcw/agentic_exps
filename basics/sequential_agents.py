Sequential Agents for Weather Information Pipeline

This module demonstrates a sequential agent workflow using Google ADK that:
1. Uses a web search agent to find the capital city nearest to a requested location
2. Uses a weather agent to get weather information for that capital city
3. Includes the current time in Taipei at the end

Based on Google ADK Sequential Agents documentation:

When given a location, use the google_search tool to:
1. Search for information about the location and its nearest major capital city
2. Identify which country the location is in, or which country's capital is nearest
3. Find the specific capital city name

Important guidelines:
- If the location is already a capital city, return that city
- If the location is within a country, return that country's capital
- If the location is near borders, find the nearest major capital city
- Focus on finding the CAPITAL CITY specifically, not just major cities
- Be precise about the capital city name

Store your findings using the key "capital_city" in your response.
Format your response as: "The nearest capital city to [location] is [capital_city], [country]."

3. Present the information in a clear, user-friendly format

Important guidelines:
- Use the exact capital city name provided by the previous agent

- Provide detailed weather information in an organized format
- Include all available weather metrics

3. Present everything in a well-organized, user-friendly format

Important guidelines:
- Always include the Taipei time at the end of your response
