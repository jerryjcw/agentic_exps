### Prioritized List of Actionable Improvements

#### 1) High-Priority Security Fixes

1. **Correct F-String Syntax**
   - **Issue**: Both `test_a.py` and `test_b.py` exhibit incorrect HTML encoded curly braces in f-strings, which will lead to syntax errors.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Update all f-string instances to use standard curly braces (`{}`).
     - Example correction in both scripts:
       ```python
       print(f"The current working directory is {os.getcwd()}")
       print(f"a + b = {a + b}")
       ```
   - **Expected Benefits**: Ensures the code executes correctly without raising syntax errors, leading to more reliable script behavior.

2. **Information Exposure**
   - **Issue**: `test_b.py` prints the current working directory, which might expose sensitive information in logs.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Add a conditional check to restrict this print operation to non-production environments.
       ```python
       if os.getenv('ENV') != 'production':
           print(f"The current working directory is {os.getcwd()}")
       ```
   - **Expected Benefits**: Reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks when the script is run in potentially sensitive or shared environments.

#### 2) Performance Optimizations

1. **Remove Unnecessary Imports**
   - **Issue**: Unused imports such as `sys` in both files can slow down script startup time and increase memory usage.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Remove unused imports from the scripts.
     - Example correction:
       ```python
       # import sys  # Remove this line
       import os
       ```
   - **Expected Benefits**: Reduces memory footprint and improves script performance by only loading necessary modules.

#### 3) Code Quality Improvements

1. **Comment and Documentation Enhancements**
   - **Issue**: The script purpose and functionality are unclear due to lack of comments.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Add comments or a docstring at the top of each script explaining its intended use.
     - Example:
       ```python
       """
       test_b.py - This script prints a test message and the current working directory.
       Only use in development environments.
       """
       ```

2. **Consistent Style Adherence (PEP 8)**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent styling can lead to reduced readability.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Run a linter like `flake8` to ensure PEP 8 compliance.
     - Ensure consistent import ordering, spacing, and line length.
   - **Expected Benefits**: Enhances code readability and maintainability, aiding collaborative development.

#### 4) Refactoring Suggestions

1. **Parameterize Hardcoded Values in `test_a.py`**
   - **Issue**: Using hardcoded values for `a` and `b` reduces script flexibility.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - Replace hardcoded values with a function that accepts parameters.
     - Example:
       ```python
       def add_numbers(x, y):
           return x + y

       a, b = 1, 2
       print(f"a + b = {add_numbers(a, b)}")
       ```
   - **Expected Benefits**: Improves reusability of the code for different testing scenarios, making it adaptable for future expansions.

These prioritized improvements aim to enhance security, performance, and code quality of the provided scripts, ensuring they are robust and maintainable for future development.
